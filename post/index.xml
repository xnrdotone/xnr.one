Today we have a more intermediate subject in hand. Please enjoy!
What is Containerization? Simply put, instead of installing software on your operating system directly, installing it in a sandbox environment.
And what is a sandbox? Well as the name suggests really, it&amp;rsquo;s an isolated space in your computer that has no access to your real file system&amp;hellip; Well at least most of it.
Why use sanboxing though?</description></item><item><title>First Look at KDE Plasma</title><link>https://www.xnr.one/post/first-look-at-kde-plasma/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.xnr.one/post/first-look-at-kde-plasma/</guid><description>Hello once again!

What is KDE Plasma: KDE Plasma is an desktop environment created by KDE Foundation. Lets dissect that line first. What is a desktop environment?
A desktop environment is basically your operating systems graphical interface. It gets info from your computer and shows you as images and symbols.

Distribution? What is that? As I said in my last blog post, *nix isn&amp;rsquo;t a single operating system but more of a standard for an operating system family.

I mean, It&amp;rsquo;s actually way more than that but lets start simple shall we? Take Windows for example. You can&amp;rsquo;t run your Windows programs without running windows can you?</description></item></channel></rss>
