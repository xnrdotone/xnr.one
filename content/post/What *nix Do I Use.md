Hello again, today I'll explain why and which \*nix distribution I use.

---

#### Distribution? What is that?

As I said in my last blog post, \*nix isn't a single operating system but more of a standard for an operating system family. The most important two main branches of this family are BSD and Linux. For example Mac OS X is a BSD distribution and Ubuntu is a Linux distribution I won't try to write the whole distribution tree because that will take ages but [this image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Unix_history-simple.png) may give you an idea. And that's only the main branches. When you look at just Linux itself it gets [much wilder](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg) not the mention that image barely covers anything.













#### Release cycles:

Just like most online software \*nix distributions gets updates too. Since \*nix is quite fragmented some \*nix distributions receive updates slower and some receive faster.
