Today I want to recommend some Linux content creators I personally watch or at least watched at one point when I was an beginner.
The ones I would recommend you to watch: - The Linux Experiment - This fellow is absolutely awesome. He does content varying from weekly Linux and opensource news to Linux hardware reviews. There is something for everyone in this channel and is possibly the best Linux news channel you can find.</description></item></channel></rss>
