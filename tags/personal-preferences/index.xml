Today I want to recommend some Linux content creators I personally watch or at least watched at one point when I was an beginner.
The ones I would recommend you to watch: - The Linux Experiment - This fellow is absolutely awesome. He does content varying from weekly Linux and opensource news to Linux hardware reviews. There is something for everyone in this channel and is possibly the best Linux news channel you can find.</description></item><item><title>What *nix Should You Use?</title><link>https://www.xnr.one/post/what-nix-should-you-use/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.xnr.one/post/what-nix-should-you-use/</guid><description>Hello again, today I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why and which *nix distribution I use.

Cool but what is *nix? *nix is an acronym for &amp;ldquo;Unix-like operating system&amp;rdquo;. An operating system simply put is a container for programs for you to use. I mean, It&amp;rsquo;s actually way more than that but lets start simple shall we? Take Windows for example. You can&amp;rsquo;t run your Windows programs without running windows can you?</description></item></channel></rss>
